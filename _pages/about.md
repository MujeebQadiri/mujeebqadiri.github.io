I graduated with a B.S in biochemistry and a minor in general biology from the University of California, San Diego in 2020. I later obtained an MSc in bioinformatics at Northeastern University in 2024. I have prior experience as a Research Assistant II in the Emerling Lab at the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute. I previously worked as a Bioinformatics Scientist in the Perrimon Lab in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School.
