I graduated with a B.S in biochemistry and minor in general biology at the University of California, San Diego in 2020. I later went on to obtain a MSc in bioinformatics at Northeastern University in 2024. I have prior experience as a research assistant II in the Emerling lab at Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute. I previously worked as a bioinformatics scientist in the Perrimon Lab in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School.
